Machine setups
==============

Code that sets up my computers with the software and configuration I want, and allows for them to stay in sync later.

You will also find the public part of my configuration and utility scripts in here.

Usage
------------

- Pull this repo with Git submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules <repo URL>`
- (to install or to update the configuration) run the setup command from `Makefile` with `make`

TODO say that when the config changes you can just see that, revert or commit it with git.
