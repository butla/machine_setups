Machine setups
==============

This is the code that sets up my computers with the software and configuration I want.
It also allows for keeping the configurations (and software) in sync between computers.

You will also find the public part of my utility scripts and configuration in here.

Installation
------------

Check out the commands in the `Makefile`. They should be self-explanatory.
