Manjaro home RPI server, a playbook
===================================

## DONE
Image: Manjaro Minimal for RPI 4

```
$ 7z x Manjaro-ARM-minimal-rpi4-22.06.img.xz
sudo dd if=Manjaro-ARM-minimal-rpi4-22.06.img of=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress
```

## TODO
- Connect over ethernet
  - first remember sudo nmap -sn 192.168.50.0/24
  - check again after connecting and turning on the RPI
  - compare results: `meld scan_1 scan_2`
  - found you:
  ```
  MAC Address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Raspberry Pi Trading)
  Nmap scan report for 192.168.50.184
  Host is up (0.034s latency).
  ```
  - no open ports, maybe I burned it wrong? Or maybe I need to put something on the SD card.
    More googling/duckduckgoing awaits.
