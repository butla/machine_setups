# Hopefully, pruning the backups won't last long enough so that the next sudo call will require manual input.
# That's why it's called first.
# Backup can take longer than 15 minutes (the default sudo credentials cache time, I think)
# I'd just run the whole script as root, but then I'd need to put it in a location that's on the root user's PATH.
# And I don't want to go through that hassle just yet.
