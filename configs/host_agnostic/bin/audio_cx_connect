# after some time of not using, the earphones disconnect and
#
# bluetoothctl connect 00:1B:66:A1:C3:66
#
# doesn't help.
# reconnecting the earphones does work, though.
# Script should say reconnect then press enter,
# or hit ctr+c (interrupt process) or ctrl+d (end of input/file) to quit.

# TODO if there are errors, this might require repairing.
# Prompt the user to enable pairing on the device again.
# Then scan, and when it appears try pairing, when it pairs connect.
# Flow:
# - remove
# - scan
# - try pairing
# - wait until it says pairing successful (
