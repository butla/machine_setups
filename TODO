ve - find files with FZF in common places (Documents, .config, Downloads) and edit

open any image / copy to clipboard with FZF.
Or better - bemenu, with meta+m (for media) (maybe upper case, lower is move)
check "grafika" and whatever photo folders are available

`upgrade` script needs to be added for root so that it can run with sudo.

?drop yay - use pamac with AUR?

Eventually have an async task DAG with stops requiring human interaction.

replace repl article - tmux command for a split with Vim and entr.
default file nam

bh:
ln -s /data/grafika grafika

===========================
Add this to the default Python script:
---------------------------
from pathlib import Path


def main():
    home_path = Path('~').expanduser()
    print('The $HOME is', home_path)
    print('Now get shit done...')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
