Gnome desktop notes
===================

Shutdown shortcut - ctrl+alt+delete

CLI gnome extensions installer: https://github.com/brunelli/gnome-shell-extension-installer
Might come in handy if I want to automatically set up some extensions.
Sadly, the audio swither extensions don't work on my (new) version of Gnome.
